Bluetooth Low Energy with Android and Arduino
#############################################


These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy with iOS Swift_.  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices using iOS/Swift.  

If you find these examples helpful and you haven't purchased the book, please consider doing so.
